# A public history project, 'Mapping the Transport Network of England & Wales, 1530-1680'.

We are not simply aiming to map the developing network of roads and waterways over a century and a half from the early years of the English Renaissance, and nor do we suggest that by 1680 the network was already fit to serve an emerging industrial economy. Rather, we want to examine the developments that did occur, as indicators of economic, industrial, and demographic change. We want to discover how, where, when, and to what extent the nation was already industrialising in the centuries before the so-called Industrial Revolution. And we want to look at factors that influenced the likelihood of a settlement developing into a commercially successful town.
